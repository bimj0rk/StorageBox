# Storage Box v2

For this project, I created a Storage Box that acts as a Vallet Tray.

The box is based on the Arduino Nano with the ESP32 Wi-Fi Module. 

The library used, HomeSpan, allows the device to act as an HomeKit Bridge and device at the same time.

For some technical reasons, the box is displayed as a Window Blind in-app.
